# Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec for Speech Processing

## Overview
This project is based on the lab proposed by Université Paris Cité for exploring speech processing with Wav2Vec. It leverages the multilingual XLS-R 53 model for tasks such as automatic transcription, language similarity evaluation, and hierarchical clustering.

The work involves building and fine-tuning audio transcription pipelines, analyzing language distances through vector representations, and exploring the challenges and limitations of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

## Introduction
Wav2Vec is a transformer-based model designed to process and understand speech data. The XLS-R 53 model extends its capabilities to multilingual settings, enabling the analysis of audio data across languages. This project focuses on creating audio datasets, fine-tuning ASR systems, and quantifying language similarities through vector representations.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement Wav2Vec-based transcription systems.
- Create and manage multilingual audio corpora.
- Evaluate transcription accuracy using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER).
- Measure language distances through cosine similarity of vector representations.

## Implementation Details
1. **Audio Data Processing**
   - Record and process audio files using Python libraries (`scipy`, `librosa`).
   - Normalize audio to ensure compatibility with the model (e.g., 16kHz sampling rate).

2. **Automatic Transcription**
   - Use pretrained Wav2Vec models from HuggingFace for French and English transcription tasks.
   - Store results in pandas DataFrames for further analysis.

3. **Language Distance**
   - Compute language representations using XLS-R embeddings.
   - Evaluate pairwise language similarities using cosine distance.

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate hierarchical clustering maps to represent language distances.

## Experiments
### Audio Corpus Creation
- Created a multilingual corpus containing 10 sentences (300 words) for each language, with a mix of technical terms, everyday phrases, and proper nouns.

### Automatic Transcription
- Compared transcription quality of French (`jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-french`) and English (`jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-english`) models.
- Evaluated transcription accuracy using Word Error Rate (WER).

### Language Similarity Analysis
- Measured the cosine similarity between language embeddings generated by XLS-R.
- Clustered results to analyze the relative similarities among languages (e.g., French, German, English, Spanish, Italian, Catalan).

## Key Findings
- **Transcription Quality**: The models showed relatively accurate results, but struggled with punctuation, case sensitivity, and certain word contractions.
- **WER Analysis**: Preprocessing steps, such as case normalization and punctuation removal, significantly improved WER scores.
- **Language Similarity**:
  - Languages within the same family (e.g., Romance or Germanic) showed higher similarity.
  - Hierarchical clustering highlighted relationships between languages, with French being closest to Italian and Spanish, but further from English.
